# uStockMarket
A very simple stock market simulator

## Description

This project implements a very simple stock market into which the users should use a RESTful API in order to acquire market data and to send orders.

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is for me to acquire and develop skills on the Flask framework with the MongoDB database.

- Python 3.6
	- flask-0.12.2
	- flask-restful 0.3.6

## Usage

The system as a hole is comprised of 3 parts:

- ***uStockMarket***: the webserver responsible for simulating the stock market itself
- ***uTraders***: a program that simulates various traders that will buy and sell stocks on the stock market
- ***uHomeBroker***: a program that emulates a simple home broker so the user can see the stock market data and send his own orders
